        <h1>Jon M. Carter (Old Dog, New Tricks!)</h1>
        <p><em>CEO of really <strong>nothing at all!</strong></em></p>
        <p>This is the first web site or page I have ever created.
          I'm doing so in hopes of proving to myself that I can teach this
          old dog some new tricks! Most of the younger generation in my family makes fun
          of me when they change a setting on my television
          and I can't even get my channels back! So, the thought of <strong>ME</strong>
          actually learning to be tech savvy is a bit of a joke.
          However, I'm finding that the more I learn, the more I'm enjoying it
          and becoming confident that I really can teach this old dog some new tricks.
          Wish me some luck, will ya?</p>
